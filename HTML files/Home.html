Numonix goes beyond memorization to allow students to practice essay-based questions and short-answer questions related to any topics. To learn their topics students can mind map their topic based on keywords and can practice based on questions at each level of the learning hierarchy. To consolidate knowledge Numonix uses spaced repetition to remind students to study effectively!
